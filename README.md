# statistical_grammar_checker
The majority of today’s grammar checkers are still rule-based. But as Data Science and statistical methods are gaining relevance in NLP, grammar checking can also be performed on the basis of Big Data- as opposed to grammar rules.
The task of this semester project is to develop a statistical grammar checker.
Your prototype (for English, German or Chinese) should include (at least) the following features:
-  a GUI via which input can be typed,
-  a match of the input (of n-grams thereof) to „big data“, i.e. large corpora which are available online
-  a calculation on the basis of statistical methods (e.g. n-gram counts, Markov probabilities,…), the detection & 
handling of errors
- a suggestion of a correction (i.e. a more likely string).

In addition, each group will submit a written report (approx. 10-15 pages) on their semester project. The duedate for all reports will be Feb. 11, 2021.
